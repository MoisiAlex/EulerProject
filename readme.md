JAVASCRIPT BASICS - the Odin Project 

I am following along with the Odin Projectand as part of the JavaScript path I wanted to practice putting together a basic site that uses Java to modify some elements.

My original solution a very simple script

var sum=0;

for (var i=0; i<1000;i++){
    if((i%3==0) || (i%5==0)){
    sum+=i;
 }
 
Inspired by the other solutions submited I built on this script and made it more flexible by breaking down the colletion of inputs, calulating if a number is a multiple and updating the HTML page via functions. You can now enter multiple factors along with the max number it will count until.
