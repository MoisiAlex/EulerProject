JAVASCRIPT BASICS - the Odin Project 

The first Javascript project for The Odin Project asks you to try and resolve some Project Euler problems. So far I resolved the first 2 problems and inspired by the other solutions submited I built a simple website that collects inputs from users and updates various DOM elements.
